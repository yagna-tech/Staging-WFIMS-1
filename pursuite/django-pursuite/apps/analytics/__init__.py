        [James 4:17] So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it,
        for him it is sin.

    That said, this code sucks because data sucks. Its incomplete with no
    structure, no description, inconsistent and well what not.

        [Ezekiel 25:17] The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
        the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
        he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through
        the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the
        finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
        vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my
        brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
        upon thee.
